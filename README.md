#Offline Application

I created this simple webapp based on javascript, angularjs, html5, css3 as a test for mobile and desktop devices to run on and offline as the same way.


##Some features:

- Store and manipulate data in local browser, even offline status;
- Mobile navigation without javascript or plugin is required;
- Detect the device type as well the orientation;
- Only as an experimental test, I've created a fullscreen lib to navigate;



##TODO
- Improve the documentation;
- Make the coverage tests in the code generated;
- Split the libs that was created, like: notify, mediaquery, localstorage and others to separated projects;

-- I'll continue this README later;
